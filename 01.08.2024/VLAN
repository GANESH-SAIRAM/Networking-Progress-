VLAN: 
Its mainly to eradicate the issues in the Broadcast Domain

Broadcast Domain:
Group of devices receive the broadcast address send by any one of the member.

Dividing the Network:
When we divide the network based on the department or any other requiremens we can implement the security policies for the different network.
But when we broadcast,the switch broadcast to all the devices which they are connected even though we split the network by departments.

VLAN:
To solve this issue VLAN are created 
It doesn't perform the Inter Vlan routing 
It only sends the traffic through the router 

About VLAN:
There are about 5 VLAN default in a switch 
VLAN 1,1002-1005
When we need the total VLAN = 5 + No. of VLAN created 
VLAN are created one for the one interface and the devices follow the interface belongs to the particular VLAN
VLAN separate the network/logical device in Layer 2

Access Port:
One interface contains one VLAN

Trunk Port:
One interface contains the multiple VLAN 

No. of devices in the case of Vlan process : PC + Switch+ Router 

VLAN 1 
VLAN 1002 : fddi default 
VLAN 1003 : token ring default 
VLAN 1004 : fddinet default 
VLAN 1005 : trnet default 

Commands : 

#show vlan interface brief 
sw(config)#interface range g1/0 - 3(no. of device)
sw(config-if-range)#switchport access VLAN 20(assigning interface to the VLAN)
sw(config)#vlan 20
sw(config-VLAN)#name Lab
